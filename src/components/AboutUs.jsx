					Time&Place Funding was the brainchild of Kjeld B. Olesen and
					Glenn Cezanne in 2017 (after becoming friends during
					motorcycle driving lessons), to address client needs in
					attaining public funding for innovative projects. The range
					of services quickly developed with the team growing
					exponentially to provide monitoring,
					government/administrator-engagement, 360-project management
					and competitive proposal drafting service for public
					funding, finance and tenders. Within this context it has
					always been important to have the team located strategically
					so that our clients are able to have local access.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Why is this important? Speaking the local language is an
					absolute asset but understanding the context for the most
					competitive proposal is indispensable according to our
					strategy. Our locally based teams are able to engage
					government before opportunities are published or to
					understand the intentions behind the opportunities and the
					meaning between the lines of the requests for proposals.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					These are just a few advantages when taking into account
					potential consortium partners and new project opportunities
					that come with a global network. In other words, when an
					opportunity arises through our team located in one part of
					the world, we can find the right partners on the other side
					of the planet. This can be a significant asset when building
					a consortium within the scope of the EU’s innovation funding
					regime.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-4">
					Kjeld’s and Glenn’s dream project came true, but there is a
					bigger picture to it all. Glenn being a Public Affairs and
					Association Management professional, and Founder of
					Time&Place Group, and Kjeld being a lecturer and project
					management guru, they sought to integrate Time&Place Funding
					as a pillar of the Group. The advantage? An integrated offer
					for the clients bringing together education, government
					relations, media, training, public relations, think tanks –
					just to name a few – capacities to give a holistic approach
					to impacting decision-making and supporting our clients’
					agendas.
